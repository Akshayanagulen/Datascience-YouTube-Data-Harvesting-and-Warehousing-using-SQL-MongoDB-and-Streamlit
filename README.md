**Project Title:** YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing using SQL, MongoDB and Streamlit

**Skills take away From This Project:** 
1. Python scripting
2. Data Collection
3. MongoDB
4. Streamlit
5. API integration
6. Data Management using MongoDB (Atlas)
7. SQL 

Streamlit application that allows users to access and analyze data from multiple YouTube channels. 

**Approach:**

**Set up a Streamlit app:**
Streamlit is a great choice for building data visualization and analysis tools quickly and easily. 
I have used Streamlit to create a simple UI where users can enter a YouTube channel ID, view the channel details, and select channels to migrate to the data warehouse.

**Connect to the YouTube API:** 
I have used the YouTube API to retrieve channel and video data. 
I used the Google API client library for Python to make requests to the API.

**Store data in a MongoDB data lake:** 
Once you retrieve the data from the YouTube API, we can store it in a MongoDB data lake. 
MongoDB is a great choice for a data lake because it can handle unstructured and semi-structured data easily.

**Migrate data to a SQL data warehouse:** 
After the collected data for multiple channels, you can migrate it to a SQL data warehouse. 
I have used PostgreSQL for this.

**Query the SQL data warehouse:** 
I have used SQL queries to join the tables in the SQL data warehouse and retrieve data for specific channels based on user input. 
You can use a Python SQL library to interact with the SQL database.

**Display data in the Streamlit app:** 
Finally, we can display the retrieved data in the Streamlit app. 
Streamlit's data visualization features to create charts and graphs to help users analyze the data.

Overall, this approach involves building a simple UI with Streamlit, retrieving data from the YouTube API, 
storing it in a MongoDB data lake, migrating it to a SQL data warehouse, querying the data warehouse with SQL, and displaying the data in the Streamlit app.
